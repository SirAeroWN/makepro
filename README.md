Makepro is a command line utility to create project folders containing 
requested files and a Makefile depending on the requested files. It 
autmatically sets up some files with necessary code for you.

To install:

move "makepro" and "makepro.py" into ~/.makepro/
create or edit ~/.bash_aliases so that it has the line:
	alias makepro="~/.makepro/makepro"

if you have problems, try running "chmod +x ./makepro" from the 
".makepro" directory
